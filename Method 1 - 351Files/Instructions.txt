Instructions:

Copy the folders from the ZIP to your roms partition (or ROMS TF card)

Open a game in Retroarch

Close content

Load content

Navigate to storage / roms / ports_scripts and launch the 351files.sh

DTB is in a roof folder called Flash.

** In consoles with a 1:1 screen the file explorer will not occupy the entier screen, so if a folder seems like it is missing files just scroll down and they will show up.
